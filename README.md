# Bike Sales Analysis
![]("bike_sales_dashboard.png")

This repository contains the code for my second data analytics project completed with Microsoft Excel. The project involved analyzing bike sales data by education, region, marital status, average income, age brackets, gender, and other factors. Slicers were used to provide an interactive experience for dissecting the information. I had more fun working on this project compared to the first one.
